# Prepare your unit testing
Are you serious about software development? Then you need unit testing. And for unit testing, you need a dedicated tests\ folder.

Inside that folder, you create one or more test_whattheteststest.py scripts. These scripts will be picked up by the pytest module. The simplest way to run these tests is to just type the following in your terminal:

`pytest`

Hopefully all your future tests will pass gracefullyâ€¦
