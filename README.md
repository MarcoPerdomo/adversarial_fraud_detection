Fraud Detection using adversarial attack and explainability

## Useful commands
To store installed libraries straight into a requirements.txt file, this command is very useful:

`pip freeze > requirements.txt`

## To Install project dependencies
Now that we defined what Python modules need to live inside the virtual environment, letâ€™s install them. We use the standard pip utility. You can also use conda but then you would have to specify an environment.yaml file, see here to learn more about this approach.

Installing goes like:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
